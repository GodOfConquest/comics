comics
======

*comics* is a web comics aggregator. Out of the box it can crawl and archive
more than a hundred comics every day. The comics are made available through an
easy to use web interface were multiple users can create sets of their favorite
comics. Alternatively, *comics* provides feeds of both single comics and sets
of comics.

Adding a new comic to your installation requires only the addition of a single
Python file with some metadata and a few lines of code. To make crawler
development easy, *comics* comes with both documentation and powerful APIs for
crawling web sites and feeds.

*comics* runs on Python and Django. It is licensed under the GNU Affero General
Public License version 3.
