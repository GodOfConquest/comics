*comics* is a web based aggregator for web comics. It was originally developed
as a tailored web application for http://comics.jodal.no/, but the source code
has later been generalized and released for others to change and use.

The *comics* source code is available at http://github.com/jodal/comics.

The *comics* documentation is available in the ``docs/`` directory in
reStructruedText format, and online at http://jodal.github.com/comics/.
