comics
======

*comics* is a web comics aggregator. Out of the box it can crawl and archive
about two hundred comics every day. The comics are made available through an
easy to use web interface were users can build personalized collections of
their favorite comics, and then read them on the site or export them using
feeds.

Adding a new comic to your installation requires only the addition of a single
Python file with some metadata and a few lines of code. To make crawler
development easy, *comics* comes with both documentation and powerful APIs for
crawling web sites and feeds.

*comics* runs on Python and Django. It is licensed under the GNU Affero General
Public License version 3.
