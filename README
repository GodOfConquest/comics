Daily Comics (aka comics)
=========================

Daily Comics is a web based aggregator for web comics. It was originally
developed as a custom web application hosted at http://comics.jodal.no/, but
the source code has later been released for others to change and use.

Daily Comics is maintained by Stein Magnus Jodal, with comments and input from
numerous users. The software is freely available under the GPLv2 license. You
can get the source using the version control system git and the command

    git clone git://github.com/jodal/comics.git

or you can browse the source online at http://github.com/jodal/comics.

Feature requests, bug reports and patches are warmly received, read and replied
to at comics@jodal.no or through the feedback page at
http://comics.jodal.no/feedback/.


Is it legal?
------------

The code is legal. Copying and distributing some of the comics may not be.
Anyway nobody is making any money here, and the intention is having fun
developing software and reading comics.


Dependencies
------------

The dependencies are listed as Debian/Ubuntu package names.

- python (>=2.5, at least hashlib is new in 2.5)
- python-django (>=1.0)
- python-feedparser
- python-lxml

Optional dependencies if you want to use a real database and/or memcache:

- python-psycopg2
- postgresql-X.Y (developed with 8.3)
- cmemcache (from source, or alternatively python-memcache)

Additional dependencies which are handy for development:

- python-pmock (for mocking in unit tests)
- python-coverage (for checking test coverage)
- debug_toolbar (for debugging, from
  http://code.google.com/p/django-debug-toolbar/)


Installation
------------

To get comics up and running from a clean checkout is as easy as:

    git clone git://github.com/jodal/comics.git
    cd comics/comics/
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py loadmeta
    python manage.py getcomics
    python manage.py runserver

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8000/ to start reading comics.


Usage
-----

To run unit tests:

    python manage.py test --settings=comics.settings.testing

To run unit tests with statement coverage:

    python manage.py test --settings=comics.settings.coverage

To load meta data for new or existing comics:

    python manage.py loadmeta

To fetch new comic strips:

    python manage.py getcomics

Add `--help` to get further instructions.


TODO
----

A mostly unordered list of things to fix. Patches accepted.

- comics.comics.pennyarcade:
  Move web page string decoding to comics.aggregator.lxmlparser.
- comics.aggregator.crawler._decode_feed_data():
  Move feed string decoding to comics.aggregator.feedparser/lxmlparser.
- comics.aggregator.crawler._get_date_to_crawl():
  Use comics time zone to crawl the correct current date.
- comics.aggregator.command:
  Use comic week schedule to crawl less often on non-schedule days.
- comics.core.utils.navigation:
  Unit test and refactor.

New features:

- Support multiple strips per comic per day, which requires:
    - Change of naming scheme for image files from date to checksum.
    - Optionally support for returning multiple CrawlerResults from one crawl().
